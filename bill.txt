        not sufficient to conclude that a positive association is at 
        least as likely as not, or is not sufficient to make a

                            (i) A lack of a presumption of service 
                        connection is not by itself sufficient to 
                        determine that service connection does not 
                        exist.
                            (ii) The claims adjudicator shall always 
                        consider whether direct service connection is

                        302, but a lack of such information is not by 
                        itself sufficient to determine that such 
                        exposure did not occur or sufficient to deny 
                        the claim.
                    (C) Provision of training.--The Secretary shall--
                            (i) provide training under subparagraph (A)

                date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall 
                ensure that a standard medical training curriculum 
                exists for medical providers who conduct examinations
