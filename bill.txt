``Sec. 1173. Science Review Board
    ``(a) Establishment.--(1) There is in the Veterans Health 
Administration of the Department the Science Review Board (in this 
section referred to as the `Board').
    ``(2)(A) The members of the Board shall be appointed by the 
Secretary, in consultation with the National Academies of Sciences, 
Engineering, and Medicine, from the general public from among 
individuals who are distinguished in the fields of medicine, biological 
sciences, or health administration.

Formal Advisory Committee on Toxic Exposure under section 1172 of this 
title.

Secretary.
    ``(b) Duties.--(1) Upon receiving a nomination for the evaluation 
of research on the health effects of toxic exposures of members of the 
active military, naval, or air service or dependents of such members 
made by the Secretary, the Board shall--
            ``(A) evaluate the likelihood that a positive association 
        exists between an illness and a toxic exposure while serving in 
        the active military, naval, or air service; and

        by the Secretary and determine whether the evidence supports a 
        finding of a positive association between the toxic exposure 
        and the illness.
    ``(2) In carrying out paragraph (1)(B), the Board shall review all 
relevant data to determine the strength of evidence for a positive 
association based on the following four categories:
            ``(A) The `sufficient' category, where the evidence is 
        sufficient to conclude that a positive association exists.
            ``(B) The `equipoise and above' category, where the 
        evidence is sufficient to conclude that a positive association 
        is at least as likely as not, but not sufficient to conclude 
        that a positive association exists.
            ``(C) The `below equipoise' category, where the evidence is 
        not sufficient to conclude that a positive association is at 
        least as likely as not, or is not sufficient to make a 
        scientifically informed judgment.

        the lack of a positive association.

subsection, if the Board determines that the evidence for a positive 
association is categorized as either the sufficient or equipoise and 
above categories, the Board shall estimate the size of the positive 
association effect among those exposed by calculating the relative risk 
and exposure prevalence.
    ``(B)(i) The Board shall use the relative risk and exposure 
prevalence calculated under subparagraph (A) to estimate the service-
attributable fraction of illness in a military setting to determine the 
probability of positive association for an individual.
    ``(ii) In calculating the service-attributable fraction of illness, 
the Board shall consider the dose-response relationships.

subsection, if the Board determines that the evidence for a positive 
association is categorized as the below equipoise category, the Board 
shall develop a recommendation as to whether additional data gathering 
and research are necessary.
    ``(B) If the Board recommends additional data gathering and 
research pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall seek to 
enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, 
Engineering, and Medicine, or another nonprofit, nongovernmental entity 
that the Secretary determines has similar expertise and objectivity as 
the National Academies, to conduct such data gathering and research.

(b) where the Board determines that the evidence for positive 
association is categorized as either the sufficient or equipoise and 
above categories, the Board shall submit to the Secretary a report 
identifying the evidence found to reach such positive association 
determinations.

                            (i) A lack of a presumption of service 
                        connection is not by itself sufficient to 
                        determine that service connection does not

                            (ii) The claims adjudicator shall always 
                        consider whether direct service connection is

                        such title, as added by section 302, but a lack 
                        of such information is not by itself sufficient 
                        to determine that such exposure did not occur 
                        or sufficient to deny the claim.
                    (C) Provision of training.--The Secretary shall--
                            (i) provide training under subparagraph (A)

                        adjudication of claims relating to toxic 
                        exposure.
            (2) Standard medical examiner training curriculum.--
                    (A) Curriculum.--Not later than 180 days after the 
                date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall 
                establish a standard medical training curriculum for 
                medical providers who conduct examinations and provide 
                opinions pursuant to section 1168 of title 38, United 
                States Code, as added by section 303, regardless of 
                whether the provider is an employee of the Department 
                or a contractor.

                        and
                            (ii) instructs medical providers to 
                        consider, when conducting an examination or 
                        providing an opinion--
                                    (I) relevant medical and scientific 
                                literature;
